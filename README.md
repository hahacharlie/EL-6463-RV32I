### PC 
The program counter is simple a 32-bit register that contains the address of the next instruction to be executed by the processor. Upon reset this will be reset to the start address. 
#### Testbench
The testbench will first test the reset, then test three normal operations to ensure correct functionality. 
### Control Unit
Control Unit is the central control for the entire processor, which it will parse the instruction that was passed in, and check the opcode (along with funct3 or possiblely funct7) to indentify what operation the ALU should do. 
#### Testbench
